# Motivation
- I don't want to do repetitive tasks.
- Every morning before I start working, I follow certain routine. (Ex) connect to VPN > clock-in (record time in) > open necessary websites > set alarm to clock-out (record time out)
- This is not only repetitive but also manual process. Also, I make mistakes because sometimes I forget to set the alarm resulting in clocking out late. I want my codes to do these things for me.

## Part1: writing codes
- python_script.py: 
  - (1) open app to clock in 
  - (2) ask user if they recorded time, and if YES is clicked, start timer 
  - (3) close time recording app '
  - (4) open necessary websites
  - (5) remind user (send notification) 5 min before clock-out
  - (6) remind user (send notification) 1 min before clock-out
- apple_script.applescript:
  - (1) open app to clock in 
  - (2) input box will pop up, user enters their phone number 
  - (3) confirmation box will pop up, if user confirms their number, script will continue
  - (4) open necessary websites
  - (5) send Message to user's phone number 1 min before clock-out
  
## Part2: converting scripts to executable app for distribution
- I want to share this wonderful tool to my friends so that we can save time together!

## Part3: comparision - Python or AppleScript?

## Part4: debugging notes
- distributing exec file in Mac as "unidentified developer"
- bad CPU in executable error
