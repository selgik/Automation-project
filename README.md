# Motivation
- Every morning before I start working, I follow certain routine. 
- Ex., connect to VPN > punch in > open necessary websites > set alarm for punch out
- This is not only repetitive but also manual process. Also, I make mistakes because sometimes I forget to set the alarm resulting in punching out late.
- I want my codes to do these things for me.

## Part1: writing automation(RPA) codes with Python vs AppleScript
- main.py: ~ in progress ~

## Part2: converting scripts to executable app for distribution
- I want to share this wonderful tool to my friends so that we can save time together!

## Part3: comparision - Python or AppleScript?

## Part4: debugging notes
- distributing exec file in Mac as "unidentified developer"
- bad CPU in executable error 

~ update in progress ~
